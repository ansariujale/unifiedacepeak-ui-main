/* Shown inside the delete dialog, before anybody presses the button.
 *
 * The whole of removing a person used to be "Are you sure, you want to delete
 * this user?" — and there was no way to become sure. Whether the main line
 * forwards to their extension, whether they are the last agent on a queue,
 * whether a menu key sends callers to them: none of it was visible here, and
 * none of it was discoverable afterwards either. The queue just stops
 * answering.
 *
 * Everything the check needs is already available from lists this admin can
 * read, so nothing new is needed from the backend. The lists are only fetched
 * once the dialog is actually open — an admin scrolling the people page should
 * not be pulling every queue and menu in the company on the off-chance.
