/* Says why things have stopped working, before somebody has to guess.
 *
 * Seven screens already check whether the plan has expired, and each one quietly
 * disables its buttons. Nothing anywhere says why. So an admin finds they cannot
 * add a person, cannot buy a number, cannot change a queue — and the product
 * offers no explanation at all. The most likely reading is that it is broken.
 *
 * Established phone systems treat this as two distinct states and say so plainly:
 * on hold, where a payment failed but calls still work, and suspended, where they
 * do not. The difference matters enormously to somebody deciding how urgently to
 * act, and it is the first thing they need to know.
 *
 * Shown wherever the admin console is, not only on the billing page — the person
 * who needs this is on the screen where something just refused to work, and
 * telling them only in Billing means telling them only if they go looking.
