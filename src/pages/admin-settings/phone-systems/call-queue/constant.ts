 * IMPORTANT — these record the admin's intent. They are stored and read back,

 * rolling handle time, and a callback scheduler, none of which exist. Every
 * control is labelled in the interface as not yet in effect, following the same
 * rule the company security page set — a setting that looks live but is not is
 * worse than no setting, because an admin reads it and believes they are
