/* How far a new company has got with setting itself up.
 *
 * the usual deployment order runs offices -> users -> main line routing, and
 * the usual guidance is organisation -> locations -> people -> telephony. Both put
 * locations before people, because a person inherits their clock and their
 * address from where they sit. The order below is that order, trimmed to the
 * steps this platform actually has — network testing, desk phones, porting and
 * training have no equivalent here.
 *
 * Every count comes from data already on the account. Nothing new is stored, so
 * a company that set itself up before this existed still shows the right state
 * rather than starting from zero.
