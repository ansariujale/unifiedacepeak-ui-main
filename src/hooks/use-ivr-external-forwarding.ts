/* Reading the company switch that decides whether a phone menu key may send a
 * caller out to a number the company does not own, and answering two questions
 * for the screens that build those menus:
 *
 *   1. may "Forward to External Number" be offered at all right now?
 *   2. is this particular number an acceptable one?
 *
 * The switch lives in the reserved "Company Default" record (see
 * src/lib/company-defaults.ts) under
 *
 *   settings.company_calling_permissions.ivr_external_forwarding
 *     { allowed: boolean, domestic_only: boolean }
 *
 * `allowed` is the parent: false means no menu key may point at an outside
 * number at all. `domestic_only` is its child: when true, an outside number is
 * still permitted but only inside the account's own country. A child can never
 * be more permissive than its parent, exactly as the transfer flags on the same
 * record are read and written
 * (src/pages/admin-settings/company/company-calling-permissions.tsx:111-121
 * and :131-138).
 *
 * WHY THIS SWITCH EXISTS. A menu key that dials out is a route for toll fraud.
 * Anyone in the world can ring the main number, press a digit and be connected
 * to wherever that digit points — no login, no employee, no working hours. If
 * the digit points at a premium-rate number abroad, the fraudster is paid per
 * minute and the bill is the company's. That is why established systems ship
 * this off by default and usually restrict it to domestic numbers when it is
 * switched on at all.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HONESTY: THIS IS NOT FRAUD PROTECTION.
 *
 * This hook runs in the browser. The save endpoint accepts a menu whose key
 * forwards to any number in the world whatever this file thinks — the IVR
 * payload is posted by `upsertIVR`
 * (src/pages/admin-settings/phone-systems/ivr-menus/add-edit-ivr/index.tsx:129-136,
 * :242) and nothing in that path consults these settings. Anyone who can open
 * dev tools, or call the API directly, can still create the route.
 *
 * What it actually buys is real but modest: an administrator who is not meant
 * to build a dial-out menu key stops being offered one, and if they type a
 * foreign number into a domestic-only account they are told why before they
 * save. It stops the accident, not the attacker.
 *
 * The gate that stops toll fraud has to live in the call switch, where the
 * outbound leg is set up, or at minimum in the save endpoint. Until it does, an
 * admin who turns this off is warned, not protected. Do not describe this hook
 * as enforcement anywhere a customer will read it.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A MISSING COMPANY RECORD ALLOWS EVERYTHING. This is the part that could break
 * live call routing if it is written backwards, so it is spelled out.
 *
 * "No decision stored" is not the same as "the decision was no". A tenant that
 * has never opened Admin > Company info > Calling permissions has saved nothing
 * at all. If this hook read an absent record as "denied", then on the day it
 * shipped every such tenant would find external forwarding gone from their menu
 * editors — and any admin who opened an existing menu that already forwards to
 * an outside number, and saved it, could have that routing quietly rewritten.
 * That is a company-wide call-routing outage caused by a settings page nobody
 * visited.
 *
 * So: only a value explicitly stored as `false` restricts anything. Missing,
 * null, malformed, wrong type, and still-loading all read as permitted. The
 * mirror rule applies to the child flag: only an explicit `true` on
 * `domestic_only` narrows anything.
