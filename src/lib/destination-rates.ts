/* Every place you can call, what it costs, and what we do not know yet.
 *
 * The rates screen answers one question at a time: pick a country, see its
 * rates. That is the right shape when somebody is checking a single number
 * before they dial it, and the wrong shape for every other reason people ask.
 * "Which destinations are expensive?" and "what does our whole price list look
 * like?" cannot be answered by looking countries up one at a time, and the
 * finance team asking has no way to export anything.
 *
 * The list of destinations is not the problem - 250 countries and their
 * dialling codes are already in the app, so the table can be complete from the
 * first paint. Prices are the problem: the endpoint that has them takes exactly
 * one country per request and refuses an empty filter, so a full price list is
 * 250 round trips.
 *
 * So this module keeps the two apart. The destination list is built instantly
 * and locally; prices arrive one country at a time and are filled in as they
 * land. A row whose price has not arrived says so, rather than showing a blank
 * that reads as free.
 *
 * The distinction that matters most here, and the one a price list gets wrong:
 * "we have not fetched this yet" and "there is no rate for this destination"
 * look identical on screen unless you make them different. One is a spinner,
 * the other is a business fact, and a finance team reading the second as the
 * first will wait forever for a number that is never coming.
