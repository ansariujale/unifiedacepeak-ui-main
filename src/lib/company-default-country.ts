/* One country for the whole company, so nobody has to pick it twice.
 *
 * Buying a number starts with choosing a country, and the choice is asked from
 * scratch every single time: `initialState.location` in
 * src/pages/admin-settings/numbers/all-numbers/constants.ts is `null`, so an
 * account that has only ever bought numbers in one country still scrolls a
 * two-hundred-entry list to find it again. Most business phone systems settle
 * this once at the company level and pre-fill it everywhere afterwards.
 *
 * This file is the reader for that setting. It answers one question — "which
 * country should a form open on?" — and hands back an option object in exactly
 * the shape the asking screen already uses, so wiring it in is one line.
 *
 * Where the answer comes from, in order:
 *
 *   1. settings.company_policies.default_country — an ISO alpha-2 code saved
 *      from Admin > Company > Policies, alongside the other keys that page
 *      writes (see src/pages/admin-settings/company/company-policies.tsx).
 *   2. The main location's country. A location already stores one, and the
 *      location marked as main is the company's own address — a far better
 *      guess than an empty box. See src/pages/admin-settings/company/index.tsx,
 *      which marks the main location with `is_default === '1'`.
 *   3. Nothing. An account with neither must behave exactly as it does today.
 *
 * Three rules it will not bend:
 *
 *   1. It never overrides a country somebody has already chosen on a form. It
 *      fills an empty field or it returns null; there is no third outcome.
 *   2. It never invents a country the account cannot actually use. The seed is
 *      always an object taken from the list the screen itself was given, so a
 *      country the number supplier does not sell in can never be pre-filled.
 *   3. No company value and no main location means no seed at all — not a
 *      guessed 'US', not the first entry of a list.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: no React, no query client, no network. Hand it the company
 * settings blob, the site rows and the form's current value, get an option back.
