/* What a location still needs before it is safe to put people in it.
 *
 * On established business phone systems a location is not just a label — it decides which
 * address emergency services are sent to, what number people show when they dial
 * out, and which clock the business hours run on. Both platforms refuse to let a
 * location be used until the critical parts are filled in.
 *
 * This platform has no such gate: a location can be created with a name and
 * nothing else, and nothing anywhere says so. The checks below are the honest
 * subset — every one is verifiable against a field the `sites` record actually
 * holds. Emergency address is deliberately not among them: there is no column for
 * it, so claiming to check it would be theatre. It is named on the page instead,
 * as a gap in the platform rather than a gap in the admin's data.
