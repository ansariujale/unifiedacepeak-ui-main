/* Deciding who a waiting call should ring, and when that answer changes.
 *
 * This is the whole of automatic call distribution reduced to one function. It
 * takes the queue's rules, the people in it and how long the caller has waited,
 * and returns who to ring right now. It touches no network and no switch, so it
 * can be proven with tests today and called by whatever ends up placing the
 * call — the dialplan, an API, or a screen showing an admin what would happen.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The model
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A queue rings in **steps**. Step one is the people you most want on this call.
 * If nobody answers within that step's wait, the next step is added — people are
 * added, never swapped out, so the first group keeps ringing. That widening is
 * what stops a specialist queue going unanswered because the one expert is busy.
 *
 * Each step can demand a **rating**: a number from 0 to 100 saying how well
 * somebody handles this queue's work. Everyone starts at 100, so a queue that
 * never rates anybody behaves exactly as an unrated queue does — the feature
 * costs nothing until it is used.
 *
 * Ratings are per queue, not per person. Somebody can be the strongest on
 * billing and the weakest on support, and one number per person could not say
 * that.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Duty state, which is the part most systems get wrong
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Being free is not the same as being on duty for this queue. Somebody can be
 * at their desk and deliberately not taking queue calls, or on a direct call and
 * still first in line for the queue when they finish. One on/off flag cannot say
 * either, so there are five states — and `busy` exists precisely so a person can
 * keep working without leaving the queue entirely.
