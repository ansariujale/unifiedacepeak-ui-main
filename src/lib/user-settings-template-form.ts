/* Reading a user-settings template into a form, and writing it back out.
 *
 * The stored shape and the form shape are not the same. Storage keeps flat
 * values (`type`, `type_label`) because that is what the dialplan reads; the
 * form needs `{ label, value }` pairs because that is what the select controls
 * bind to. Several fields also have two historical spellings, and two were once
 * plain booleans before they grew an `override` flag, so a record written a year
 * ago and a record written today do not look alike.
 *
 * All of that lived inline in the template drawer. The company defaults page
 * needs precisely the same translation, and a second copy would drift the first
 * time either side gained a field — a drift that shows up as a setting the admin
 * changed silently reverting. So it lives here once and both callers use it.
