/* What a person should be allowed to do on the day they are created.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM
 *
 * A role in this product is a name, a description, and a tree of tick boxes
 * that mirrors everything the company's plan includes. When an administrator
 * adds somebody they pick a role from a list, and whatever that role happens to
 * hold is what the new person gets. Nothing in this product ever decided what a
 * role *should* hold. A role created by ticking boxes at three in the afternoon
 * is the whole of the answer, and two companies that both have a role called
 * "Manager" can mean completely different things by it.
 *
 * This file is the missing opinion. Give it the company's plan and say which
 * kind of person you are setting up, and it returns the permissions that kind of
 * person should start with — plus, in plain sentences, what was granted, what
 * was deliberately held back, and anything it could not place.
 *
 * THE SIX KINDS OF PERSON, AND WHY THEY SPLIT WHERE THEY DO
 *
 * Every established phone system lands on roughly the same six, because the same
 * five questions decide where a capability sits. The questions, in the order
 * they are asked:
 *
 *   1. Does it cost money, or change the shape of the account?
 *      Buying numbers, changing the plan, paying the bill, adding a location.
 *      These go to one person and stay there. Somebody who can quietly triple
 *      the monthly bill is not an administrator, they are a signatory. This is
 *      why the person who runs a location day to day still cannot buy.
 *
 *   2. Does it change the *person*, or only the person's place in one team?
 *      Creating somebody, deleting them, changing their email address, giving
 *      them a role — that changes who they are, and belongs with whoever owns
 *      the staff list. Adding an existing person to a queue only changes their
 *      place in that queue, and belongs with whoever runs the queue. This one
 *      line separates a Location Admin from a Department Admin more cleanly
 *      than any list of screens.
 *
 *   3. Is it configuration, or is it supervision?
 *      Listening to a live call, whispering to the person on it, marking an
 *      agent unavailable — these last for one shift and are done by somebody
 *      standing next to the team. Changing where calls route lasts until
 *      somebody changes it back and affects everyone. So supervision is handed
 *      down much further than configuration is, and a supervisor gets the whole
 *      of the first and none of the second.
 *
 *   4. Whose data is it?
 *      The safe default for everybody is: your own calls, your own recordings,
 *      your own numbers. Access to anyone else's is granted, never assumed. An
 *      agent who can search the whole company's recordings on their first day
 *      is a data-protection incident waiting for a reason.
 *
 *   5. Is it just doing the job?
 *      Making calls, sending messages, chatting, keeping contacts, recording a
 *      greeting. Nobody needs permission for the thing they were hired to do,
 *      and withholding it produces a support ticket on day one.
 *
 * Run those five over any capability and the six kinds fall out. Each is named
 * after how far it reaches, not after how senior anybody is:
 *
 *   Company Admin      the whole company, money included. Usually the person
 *                      who signed up.
 *   Location Admin     one or more locations. Everything the Company Admin can
 *                      do except spend money and reshape the account. The
 *                      person who actually runs the day to day.
 *   Department Admin   one or more departments: their call handling, their
 *                      hours, their members, and watching them work. Cannot
 *                      create or delete a person.
 *   Supervisor         watches a department and nothing else. Changes no
 *                      setting. Promoted from inside the department, not sent
 *                      down from head office. That is the point of the tier:
 *                      you can trust somebody to watch a queue without
 *                      trusting them to change it.
 *   Agent              does the work, sees their own calls. The tools of the
 *                      job and nothing about anybody else.
 *   User               an ordinary person with a phone. Their own line, their
 *                      own data, nothing about anybody else.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT HAVE YET, SAID PLAINLY
 *
 *   No scope. A permission here applies to the whole company. "Department
 *   Admin" therefore means the call handling of every department, not of
 *   theirs, because there is no column saying which department is theirs.
 *   Question 2 above is only half answerable today, and the Department Admin
 *   and Supervisor defaults are written as the narrowest set that is still
 *   useful rather than the correct one. See lib/admin-scope.ts, which records
 *   the missing half, and which offers the same three kinds of reach.
 *
 *   No enforcement. The platform does not read these permissions when it
 *   answers a request. They decide what the app puts on screen. A default
 *   worked out here is a good default, not a lock, and every screen that uses
 *   this file says so on its face.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS FILE WILL NOT BEND
 *
 *   1. Never grant beyond the plan. The company's own feature tree is the
 *      ceiling. A role cannot hold a permission for something the company has
 *      not bought, because that tick box would be a promise the platform
 *      cannot keep.
 *   2. Anything unrecognised is withheld, and reported. New capabilities get
 *      added to the plan tree over time. Quietly granting one nobody has
 *      classified is how an agent ends up with the billing screen. It is
 *      returned in `undecided` so a person can decide.
 *   3. It never reads or writes anything. No React, no network, no dates. Give
 *      it a plan tree, get back a permission tree.
 */

/**
 * The six kinds of person this file has an opinion about, widest reach first.
 *
 * The name of each one says how far it reaches, not how senior somebody is.
 * That is the whole trick: "Department Admin" is not a junior administrator, it
 * is an administrator of one department. Somebody who runs two departments and
 * somebody who runs the company do the same sorts of thing to different sets of
 * people, and naming a tier after the set is what makes the ladder readable.
