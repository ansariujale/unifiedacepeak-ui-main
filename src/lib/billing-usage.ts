/* Turning a plan's allowances into the rows of the usage table.
 *
 * A customer looking at usage is asking one question: "am I about to be charged
 * extra, and for what?" Everything here exists to answer that honestly.
 *
 * The hard part is not the arithmetic — it is that the platform knows far less
 * than a usage table implies. It knows how many voice minutes a plan includes
 * and how many have been used. It does not, today, expose a per-service rate or
 * a per-service cost to a customer's own admin, and for several services it has
 * no used-count at all. A table that filled those gaps with 0 would tell
 * somebody "you have used no AI minutes and owe nothing for them" when the
 * truth is "nobody has counted". That is the kind of wrong fact that turns into
 * a refund argument, so every cell here can be `null`, and `null` means the
 * screen prints "Not available yet" rather than a number.
 *
 * The other rule worth stating: **overage only exists once an allowance is
 * known.** If we do not know what is included, we cannot know what is over, so
 * the over cell stays unknown rather than defaulting to everything used.
