/* The extras a company can have on top of its plan, and which it already has.
 *
 * An add-on is not a switch on this screen. It is a licence bought per seat, the
 * same way the plan itself is, and it changes what a person's line can do. That
 * distinction matters for the wording: "add" and "remove" here mean buying and
 * returning licences, not flicking something on.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything below, and both come from the same place - a
 * billing screen that states something untrue turns into a refund conversation.
 *
 *   The on/off state is read, never assumed. Whether a company has an add-on is
 *   decided by the plan features the platform actually reports, so the badge on
 *   each card is the truth about that account rather than a guess.
 *
 *   No price is invented. Nothing in the API supplies an add-on price, so the
 *   price line says so. A number here that turned out to be wrong would be the
 *   worst kind of wrong: somebody would budget against it.
