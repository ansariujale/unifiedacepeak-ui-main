/* Turning two stored company defaults into values for a person who is new.
 *
 * Admin > Company > Company policies saves two settings that are explicitly
 * described on screen as "the default for a NEW user":
 *
 *   settings.company_policies.voicemail.transcription_default   (boolean)
 *   settings.company_policies.international_calling.new_user_default
 *                                                     ('blocked' | 'allowed')
 *
 * Both were written and then read by nobody, so an admin who switched
 * voicemail-to-text off for new people still got it switched on for every
 * person created afterwards. This file is the missing reader.
 *
 * Three rules it will not bend:
 *
 *   1. No company record, or no `company_policies` in it, means seed NOTHING.
 *      An account that has never opened the policies page must behave exactly
 *      as it does today; an absent key is not a default of `false`.
 *   2. It only ever fills a value nobody has set. A person an admin has
 *      deliberately configured is never quietly reset — which is also why the
 *      caller must only run this when a person is being CREATED, never when an
 *      existing one is opened for editing.
 *   3. It writes the shape the rest of the product already stores. Voicemail
 *      to text is the string 'YES' or 'NO' everywhere in this codebase, so a
 *      stored boolean is translated, not passed through.
 *
 * It is deliberately pure: no React, no query client, no network. Give it the
 * company settings blob and the current form values, get back a list of
 * `setValue` arguments plus plain sentences the screen can show the admin.
