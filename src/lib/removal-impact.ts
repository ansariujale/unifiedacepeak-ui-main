/* What actually breaks when you remove somebody.
 *
 * Removing a person is the single most destructive thing an admin does here,
 * and the whole of it is one line: "Are you sure, you want to delete this
 * user?". Sure of what? Nothing on the screen says the main line forwards to
 * their extension, or that they are the only agent left on the support queue,
 * or that key 3 of the welcome menu sends every caller who presses it straight
 * to a person who will no longer exist.
 *
 * None of that is discoverable afterwards either. The queue simply stops
 * answering, and somebody works out why the following week.
 *
 * So the checks run first, and they name the thing that breaks. Every finding
 * has to answer "and then what happens to a caller", because that is the
 * question the admin is actually weighing, and an inventory of references
 * without consequences is just a list.
 *
 * Two of these are not warnings but stops: removing the last admin locks the
 * whole company out of its own settings, and neither of those can be undone
 * from inside the product.
